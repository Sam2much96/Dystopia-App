						 (Uncle osas monologue)
					Neo- sud was not the original name
					of these lands. It used to be a
					peaceful state with life's beauty,
					radiant, blessed with natural
					resources and by the God's...well,
					err...that's just a legend of
					course that's believed by no one
					save the gods themselves, and our
					former rulers.Â 
					In the beginning, the gods ruled
					over all men. One day, led by their
					king, they separated their realm
					from ours. Theirs became the divine
					realm and ours became the mortal realm. 
					Each world was then
					separated by a great divide called
					the void. One day, Esu the
					Trickster God of the Pathways found
					a way to the mortal realm and made
					a pact with a powerful head of
					state to grant him the power to
					rule over anything his heart so
					desired. But, one day, envious of
					the spread of contractual magic
					(juju) among the populace and
					neighbouring regions, dictator
			desired to conquer his
					neighbouring states, and kill all
					juju users. The war lasted 5 years,
					but one day, a man wielding the
					most powerful juju that the world
					had ever seen, fought the dictator
					and defeated him, and upon his
					death, B.O.P.E was formed; The
					Brotherhood of Powerfull Eternals,
					made up of the most powerful juju
					users on the West African
					Continent. They're a symbol of our
					strength and they ensure that juju
					is never misused among the 4
					regions again.
						 (monologue ends)

					You know, your uncle Osas fought in
					the war even though he's blind

					much already. That's it, no more
					stories for you
