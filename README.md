## Synopsis

Changing the World? Sigh. A very lofty dream. It is a feat few men ever really achieve, it's an idea that infects men to hope, fight, kill and to die. It was for this dream we hoped, fought , killed, starved, bled and died for in a hellish war that lasted 5 years. After fighting for so long, in the end you lose sight of what you're really fighting for; and when you lose someone you love, all those lofty dreams you fought so valiantly for suddenly lose meaning. After all, what's the point of changing the world, when you have no one left to share it with.
