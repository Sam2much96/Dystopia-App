# Health Bar
# Displays Health Objects Within the Scene Tree
# Features:
# (1) Shows Player Healthbar
# (2) Runs A Recursive Loop To Get An Node That Inherits Player from THe Scene Tree ( Bad Code )

# To Do:
#(1) Implement procedural animation for Healthbar
# (2) Implement Heart Empty UI animation using a Max Health Constant
# (3) Implement Peer ID for Netwworked Multiplayer
# (4) Implement Empty Heart Animation
# (5) Implement Heart Box Scaling For Mobile Devices
# (6) Implement Tweening for healthbar animation
# *************************************************
# Bugs:
# 
# (1) Currently Only Works in Local Player not Networked Multiplayer (fixed)
# (2) Does'nt scale well on Mobile Devices
# (3) Requires Reimplementation and Animation Player (Full Refactor)
