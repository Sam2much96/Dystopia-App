# Blood Particles Within the Scene Tree
# Features:
#(1) Uses CPU particles as opposed to particle 2d
# (2) Uuses an inbuilt script because it's instanced alot
# *************************************************
# To Do:
# (1 ) Play sound file through the music singleton
# Bugs
# (1) Contains a sound file, all sounds should be handled by the Music singleton.
# (2) Probably causes a performance hog by allowing high level access to a process of low priority on the scenetree
